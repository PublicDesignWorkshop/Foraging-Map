# ForagingMap
Leaflet Application for tracking growth of fruits

TODO List:
-
- Minimize or hide leaflet map during gallery mode for improving performance in mobile environment. Also hide UI window in mobile environment. The pictures on the list still take quite a few memory.
- Simple Authorization.
- Create graph with sensor data.
- Small interface bug from gallery mode to map mode
- Create Thumbnail for picture list view
- Slider doesn't work in mobile environment. (I am not sure it's because of default behavior of mobile environemnt, swiping, or slider library's bug itself.)
