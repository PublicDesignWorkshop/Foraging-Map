# ForagingMap
Leaflet Application for tracking growth of fruits

TODO List:
- Handling over 1000 data. It becomes slow if there are too many sensor data.
- Change Graph library into more responsive one.
- Small interface bug from gallery mode to map mode
- Create Thumbnail for picture list view
- Slider doesn't work in mobile environment. (I am not sure it's because of default behavior of mobile environemnt, swiping, or slider library's bug itself.)
